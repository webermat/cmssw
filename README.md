CMS Offline Software
software analysing and reconstructing physics data of the particle physics multi-purpose detector CMS (Compact Muon Solenoid)
situated at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN

forked from the JetMETdqmval group repository:

main working items in this repository
DQMOffline/JetMET --> code for data quality monitoring purposes 
-different reconstruction algorithms using different subdetectors or pattern recognition algorithms
-spots unusual behavior in data and filters good physics data

Validation/RecoJet
Validation/RecoMET
--> code for checking impact of changes in Reconstruction of data (e.g. changes in thresholds, conditions of data calibration)
